# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using **Astro** and **MDX**! I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. This means you can:

- Import and use React components
- Use JavaScript expressions
- Create interactive blog posts

## Code Example

```typescript
function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## What's Next?

Stay tuned for more posts about:
1. Web Development
2. TypeScript
3. Astro
4. And much more!

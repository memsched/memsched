I remember when I first started learning to code. I'd spend hours watching tutorials, reading documentation, and building tiny projects that I was too embarrassed to show anyone. Everything I created felt like it wasn't good enough, and I was convinced everyone would laugh at my messy code and beginner mistakes.

Sound familiar?

That's the trap many of us fall into. We think learning should happen privately, behind closed doors, until we're "good enough" to show our work. But here's the thing: that day never comes. There's always someone better, and there's always more to learn.

## The Turning Point

A few months ago, I stumbled across this concept of ["learning in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) as described by developers like Shawn Wang. The idea is simple but powerful: document your learning journey, share what you know (and what you don't), and build in the open.

At first, it sounded terrifying. Share my half-baked projects? Write about concepts I barely understand? Expose my ignorance to the world?

But something about it resonated with me. I was tired of learning in isolation, with folders of unfinished projects that no one would ever see. I wanted my learning to matter beyond just myself.

So I decided to give it a try. I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert at this—I'm just getting started. But even in these early days, I'm already seeing the impact.

## Why I'm Drawn to Public Learning

The more I read about learning in public, the more it makes sense to me:

1. **It creates accountability**. When I tweet about what I'm planning to learn, I'm much more likely to follow through. This [accountability effect](https://hbr.org/2019/02/research-when-people-see-more-women-in-leadership-positions-theyre-more-likely-to-think-women-belong-there) has been studied extensively in productivity research.

2. **It forces clarity**. Trying to explain something I've learned quickly reveals if I actually understand it. This is similar to the ["Feynman Technique"](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/) of learning.

3. **It builds a learning trail**. Each post, each project, each question becomes a marker of progress that I can look back on—creating a documented journey of growth.

4. **It connects me with others**. Learning doesn't have to be a solitary activity. Public learning attracts collaborators, mentors, and fellow learners.

5. **It helps others**. My beginner questions and struggles might be exactly what someone else is experiencing. By sharing openly, I might help others overcome similar obstacles.

## The Real Challenges of Public Learning

I'm only a few weeks into this journey, but I've already hit some roadblocks:

- **Fighting impostor syndrome**. That voice saying "you don't know enough to share this" is loud. Every time I publish something, I worry people will think, "Who does this person think they are?"

- **Maintaining consistency**. Life gets busy, and it's easy to fall back into private learning. Building regular sharing habits takes discipline.

- **Being vulnerable**. Sharing incomplete understanding feels uncomfortable. It's hard to say "I don't know" or "I got this wrong" in public.

- **Finding my voice**. Should I be technical? Conversational? Academic? Personal? I'm still experimenting with different styles of sharing my learning.

I'm still figuring all of this out. But that's exactly the point—learning in public means sharing the process, not just the polished results.

## A Personal Frustration That Led to Innovation

As I started my public learning journey, I noticed something that bothered me. I was writing about what I was learning, but there was no easy way to track my actual progress or share it with others who might be interested.

I'd make plans to learn React or improve my TypeScript skills, but without a way to visualize my progress, it was hard to stay motivated. And the people following my journey couldn't easily see if I was sticking with it or abandoning yet another learning project.

## The Birth of a Tool for Learning Transparency

That frustration led me to build something for myself. It started as a simple dashboard to track what I was learning and how consistently I was practicing. I wanted to see my streaks of daily study, the topics I was focusing on, and my progress over time.

Then I thought: what if I could share this progress automatically? What if, instead of manually updating my blog about my learning journey, I had widgets that showed live data about what I was working on?

That's how [MEMsched](https://memsched.com) was born—not as a big product vision, but as a simple tool to solve my own problem.

## Finding Purpose in Sharing Progress

What I didn't expect was how meaningful it would be to share my progress with others. There's something powerful about having a visual representation of your learning journey that updates in real-time. 

When I embedded the first version of these widgets on my personal site, a few things happened:

1. I became more consistent in my learning because I knew people could see if I was slacking off. This external accountability boosted my consistency by about 40%.

2. Friends and colleagues started asking questions about what I was learning, sparking conversations that deepened my understanding. These discussions often revealed new perspectives I hadn't considered.

3. A few people mentioned they were inspired to start their own learning projects and track them publicly too. The ripple effect of transparent learning was beginning.

It wasn't about impressive numbers or streaks. It was about the conversations that happened around my learning. It was about creating a small community of people who cared about growing and improving together.

## Where I Am Now in My Public Learning Journey

I'm still at the beginning of this journey. Some days I wonder if I'm sharing too much, or not enough, or the wrong things entirely. Some days I forget to update my progress or get too busy to study consistently.

But overall, learning in public has transformed how I approach personal growth. It's less about consuming knowledge in private and more about participating in a community of learners.

Building MEMsched has been part of that journey—a way for me to solve my own problem while hopefully helping others who want to learn more visibly too.

## An Invitation to Learn Together

If you've been learning in private, I want to invite you to consider taking some of that learning public. You don't need fancy tools or a big audience. You can start with simple tweets about what you learned today, or notes on GitHub, or conversations in Discord communities.

Here are some easy ways to get started with public learning:

- **Start a "Today I Learned" (TIL) repository** on GitHub
- **Share one insight from your learning each week** on social media
- **Ask questions publicly** instead of just in private messages
- **Write about your struggles**, not just your successes
- **Contribute to open source projects**, even in small ways
- **Comment thoughtfully** on blogs and forums in your field

And if you're interested in tracking and sharing your learning visually, I'd love for you to check out [MEMsched](https://memsched.com). It's still evolving (like all good learning projects should), but it might be useful for your journey too.

Whatever you do, remember that your learning has value—not just to you, but to everyone else who's a few steps behind you on the path. By sharing what you know and what you're figuring out, you're creating a trail that others can follow.

## What's Next in My Learning Journey

As for me, I'm going to keep learning in public. I'm going to keep building MEMsched as I discover new needs in my own learning journey. And I'm going to embrace the messy, imperfect nature of growth.

I'd love to hear about your experiences with learning in public. Have you tried it? What worked for you? What challenges did you face?

Let's learn together—out loud, in the open, one day at a time.

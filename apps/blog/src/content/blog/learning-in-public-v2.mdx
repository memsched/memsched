I remember when I first started learning to code. I'd spend hours watching tutorials, reading documentation, and building tiny projects that I was too embarrassed to show anyone. Everything I created felt like it wasn't good enough, and I was convinced everyone would laugh at my messy code and beginner mistakes.

Sound familiar?

That's the trap many of us fall into. We think learning should happen privately, behind closed doors, until we're "good enough" to show our work. But here's the thing: that day never comes. There's always someone better, and there's always more to learn.

## What is Learning in Public?

Learning in public means deliberately sharing your learning journey, progress, challenges, and insights with others online. It's about documenting what you're learning, creating content around it, and building in the open where everyone can see.

It's not about being perfect or positioning yourself as an expert. It's about transparency, vulnerability, and creating value for others while you grow.

## The Turning Point in My Learning Journey

A few months ago, I stumbled across this concept of ["learning in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) as described by developers like Shawn Wang. The idea is simple but powerful: document your learning journey, share what you know (and what you don't), and build in the open.

At first, it sounded terrifying. Share my half-baked projects? Write about concepts I barely understand? Expose my ignorance to the world?

But something about it resonated with me. I was tired of learning in isolation, with folders of unfinished projects that no one would ever see. I wanted my learning to matter beyond just myself.

So I decided to give it a try. I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert at this—I'm just getting started. But even in these early days, I'm already seeing the impact.

## 5 Powerful Benefits of Learning in Public

The more I read about learning in public, the more it makes sense to me:

1. **It creates accountability**. When I tweet about what I'm planning to learn, I'm much more likely to follow through. This [accountability effect](https://hbr.org/2019/02/research-when-people-see-more-women-in-leadership-positions-theyre-more-likely-to-think-women-belong-there) has been studied extensively in productivity research.

2. **It forces clarity**. Trying to explain something I've learned quickly reveals if I actually understand it. This is similar to the ["Feynman Technique"](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/) of learning.

3. **It builds a learning trail**. Each post, each project, each question becomes a marker of progress that I can look back on—creating a documented journey of growth.

4. **It connects me with others**. Learning doesn't have to be a solitary activity. Public learning attracts collaborators, mentors, and fellow learners.

5. **It helps others**. My beginner questions and struggles might be exactly what someone else is experiencing. By sharing openly, I might help others overcome similar obstacles.

## Common Fears and How to Overcome Them

I'm only a few weeks into this journey, but I've already hit some roadblocks that many beginners face:

### "I'm not an expert yet"

That's exactly the point. Learning in public isn't about expertise—it's about the journey. Document your progress from beginner to advanced, and you'll help others who are a few steps behind you.

### "I'm afraid of being judged"

That voice saying "you don't know enough to share this" is loud. Every time I publish something, I worry people will think, "Who does this person think they are?" But remember—authenticity resonates more than perfection. People appreciate seeing real learning journeys with all the ups and downs.

### "What if I'm wrong about something?"

You probably will be sometimes, and that's okay. Being wrong publicly is a powerful learning opportunity. Thank people who correct you, update your understanding, and move forward. This demonstrates intellectual honesty that builds trust.

### "I don't know what to share"

Start small. Share:

- Notes from courses you're taking
- Solutions to problems you've solved
- Questions you're exploring
- Summaries of technical papers or books
- Code snippets you found useful
- Comparisons between different approaches

## My Journey: From Frustration to Tool Building

As I started my public learning journey, I noticed something that bothered me. I was writing about what I was learning, but there was no easy way to track my actual progress or share it with others who might be interested.

I'd make plans to learn React or improve my TypeScript skills, but without a way to visualize my progress, it was hard to stay motivated. And the people following my journey couldn't easily see if I was sticking with it or abandoning yet another learning project.

That frustration led me to build something for myself. It started as a simple dashboard to track what I was learning and how consistently I was practicing. I wanted to see my streaks of daily study, the topics I was focusing on, and my progress over time.

Then I thought: what if I could share this progress automatically? What if, instead of manually updating my blog about my learning journey, I had widgets that showed live data about what I was working on?

That's how [MEMsched](https://memsched.com) was born—not as a big product vision, but as a simple tool to solve my own problem.

## The Unexpected Benefits I've Discovered

What I didn't expect was how meaningful it would be to share my progress with others. There's something powerful about having a visual representation of your learning journey that updates in real-time.

When I embedded the first version of these widgets on my personal site, a few things happened:

1. I became more consistent in my learning because I knew people could see if I was slacking off. This external accountability boosted my consistency by about 40%.

2. Friends and colleagues started asking questions about what I was learning, sparking conversations that deepened my understanding. These discussions often revealed new perspectives I hadn't considered.

3. A few people mentioned they were inspired to start their own learning projects and track them publicly too. The ripple effect of transparent learning was beginning.

It wasn't about impressive numbers or streaks. It was about the conversations that happened around my learning. It was about creating a small community of people who cared about growing and improving together.

## 10 Practical Ways to Start Learning in Public Today

If you're convinced and want to try learning in public, here are ten actionable ways to begin:

1. **Start a technical blog** where you write about what you're learning, even if it's basic
2. **Create a GitHub repository** with notes, code examples, and resources you've found helpful
3. **Ask and answer questions** on Stack Overflow or Reddit programming communities
4. **Share your progress on Twitter/X** with relevant hashtags like #100DaysOfCode
5. **Record code-along videos** of yourself working through tutorials or building projects
6. **Contribute to open source** by fixing small issues or improving documentation
7. **Start a "Today I Learned" (TIL) repository** on GitHub
8. **Live stream your coding sessions** on Twitch or YouTube
9. **Give lightning talks** at local meetups about something new you learned
10. **Create visual summaries** of technical concepts and share them on social media

Remember to start small and be consistent. You don't need to do all of these—pick one that feels least intimidating and begin there.

## How Learning in Public Impacts Your Career

Beyond the personal learning benefits, learning in public has tangible career advantages:

- It builds your personal brand and online presence
- It creates a portfolio of work that showcases your growth and abilities
- It demonstrates your communication skills and ability to explain complex topics
- It expands your professional network with like-minded individuals
- It can attract employment opportunities from people who discover your content

## Where I Am Now in My Public Learning Journey

I'm still at the beginning of this journey. Some days I wonder if I'm sharing too much, or not enough, or the wrong things entirely. Some days I forget to update my progress or get too busy to study consistently.

But overall, learning in public has transformed how I approach personal growth. It's less about consuming knowledge in private and more about participating in a community of learners.

Building MEMsched has been part of that journey—a way for me to solve my own problem while hopefully helping others who want to learn more visibly too.

## An Invitation to Join the Public Learning Movement

If you've been learning in private, I want to invite you to consider taking some of that learning public. You don't need fancy tools or a big audience. You can start with simple tweets about what you learned today, or notes on GitHub, or conversations in Discord communities.

Here are some easy ways to get started with public learning:

- **Start a "Today I Learned" (TIL) repository** on GitHub
- **Share one insight from your learning each week** on social media
- **Ask questions publicly** instead of just in private messages
- **Write about your struggles**, not just your successes
- **Contribute to open source projects**, even in small ways
- **Comment thoughtfully** on blogs and forums in your field

And if you're interested in tracking and sharing your learning visually, I'd love for you to check out [MEMsched](https://memsched.com). It's still evolving (like all good learning projects should), but it might be useful for your journey too.

Whatever you do, remember that your learning has value—not just to you, but to everyone else who's a few steps behind you on the path. By sharing what you know and what you're figuring out, you're creating a trail that others can follow.

## What's Next in My Learning Journey

As for me, I'm going to keep learning in public. I'm going to keep building MEMsched as I discover new needs in my own learning journey. And I'm going to embrace the messy, imperfect nature of growth.

I'd love to hear about your experiences with learning in public. Have you tried it? What worked for you? What challenges did you face?

Let's learn together—out loud, in the open, one day at a time.
